## Security Policy
1. Private Key Protection
All validator and vote account keys must be stored in secure, access-controlled environments (e.g., HSMs, air-gapped systems, or encrypted storage). No private keys shall be exposed on shared or cloud-hosted systems without strict safeguards.

2. Software Updates
Validators must regularly apply security patches and maintain up-to-date versions of the Solana validator client and associated dependencies.

3. Network Hardening
Nodes should be protected behind firewalls, limit public access, and use VPN or trusted peer whitelisting where applicable. Port exposure must be minimized.

4. Monitoring and Alerts
Validators are expected to run continuous monitoring and alerting systems for node health, performance, and suspicious activity.

5. Incident Response
In the event of a suspected breach, validators must immediately disable affected keys, rotate credentials, and notify relevant network partners.
